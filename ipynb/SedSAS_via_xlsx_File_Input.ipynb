    "- The SedSAS class, this notebook, and all supporting materials were developed in a Python 3.x environment. Neither the class nor any of these supporting materials have been tested using a Python 2.x distro. *Backward compatibility is expected, but not assured.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If you do not have a Python interpreter installed on your computer (from the factory Linux UNIX, and MacOS users do; Windows users likely do not), your best bet for a trouble-free installation experience can be had here: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python. If you're more adventurous, try the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/getit/. Even if your OS does come with a Python interpreter already in place, it's probably a good idea to get a more up to date release (most OS installs are a version, or more, behind the current release). Again, I suggest the Anaconda distribution. Be sure to get a copy of Python version 3.5 or later.  \n",
    "- Required external Python Libraries and modules\\*\\*:\n",

    "A unique identifier for the sample can optionally be passed to SedSAS at the time of instantiation. Note that SedSAS doesn't really care if you provide a unique identifier, nor is it particular about how you choose to format the id. The identifier is more for the user and tracking than for code execution and so from a functional point of view, it's not even a requiremment. Nevertheless, it makes sense to provide something that helps to track what's in process, especially if you want to distinguish between samples when multiple samples are run in succession. If you wish to forego an id, the class will assign the default value: '1' as id each time the the class is instantiated."
