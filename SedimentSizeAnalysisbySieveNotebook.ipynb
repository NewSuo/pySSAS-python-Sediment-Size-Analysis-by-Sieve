    "SedSAS is a class object written in the Python programming (scripting) language. Its purpose is to provide a set of basic software-based statistical and visualization tools for analyzing unconsolidated sediment size-fraction samples collected in the field and separated using either mechanical sieves or similar analog partition-by-size methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script is a stand-alone ASCII-compliant text file with UNIX record delimiters (\\n). It can be called via user-built Python scripts (using this guide to get the user started), or through environments such as this one (Jupyter notebooks). In addition to this notebook, a small collection of sample scripts are supplied in this repository to make both learning and using the SedSAS class as simple and unobtrusive as possible. \n",

    "    - Required Python (Part I): The SedSASClass, this notebook, and all supporting materials were developed in a Python 3.x environment. Neither the class nor any of these supporting materials have been tested using a Python 2.x distro. *Backward compatibility is expected, but not assured.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Required Python (Part II): If you do not have Python (version 3.), your best bet for a trouble-free install experience can be had here: Continuum Analytics: https://www.continuum.io Anaconda. If you're more adventurous, try the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/getit/. \n",

    "    - [Required external Python Libraries and modules](#Required Libraries) List of required installed Python libraries (e.g., numpy, scipy, pandas) needed by the SedSASClass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - [User inputs](#User Inputs) Information to be provided by the user, needed to initiate and use the class\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - [Structuring Input Data](#Structuring) This very important step prepares the raw sediment weights data for loading into the pandas data frame that will passed to SedSAS class at instantiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Reading the source data into the pandas data frame](#Readingthesource): Loading the source data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - [Creating a SedSAS class instance](#instantiatingclass): creating an instance of the SedSAS class. You must create this instance before you can call any of the methods that follow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- #### User-callable Class Methods:\n",
    "    - Computational Methods:\n",
    "        - [InterpolateQuantileValues](#InterpolateQuantileValues): computes the sample data values for the  quantiles (per Folk, 1980)\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [ComputeGraphicStats](#graphic stats): compute graphical statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) for the sample data as described by Folk, 1980 and others.\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [ComputeMomentStats](#moment stats): computes the mean and standard deviation for the sample data using the method of moment formulae provided by Folk, 1980.\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [FindSampleModes](#sample modes): locates and reports [up to] the first three sample mode values seen in the sample data\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - Plotting and Console Reporting Methods:\n",
    "        - [PrintSampleWeightsDataTable](#print weight data table): prints the sample weights, percent sampled weights, cumulative weights, and sample quantile values to standard out.\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [PrintGraphicStats](#print graphic stats): prints the graphical statistics generated by method ComputeGraphicStats formatted to standard out (console)\n",

    "        - [PrintMomentStats](#print moment stats): prints the method of moment based statistics generated by method ComputeMomentStats formatted to standard out (console)\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [PrintSampleModes](#print sample modes): prints the modal values detected in the data by method FindSampleModes formatted to standard out (console)\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [PLOTSampleWtPercents](#plot sample weight percents): generates a histogram of weight percentage values for given sample as generated in the class constructor (__init__) and stored in the dataframe df\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [PLOTSampleCumWtPercents](#plot cum weight percents): generates a cumulative frequency curve (line) of weight percentage values for given sample as generated in the class constructor (__init__) and stored in the dataframe df\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "        - [PLOTDualSampleWtPercents](#plot dual sample weights): generates both a histogram and a cumulative frequency curve (line) of weight percentage values for given sample as generated in the class constructor (__init__) and stored in the dataframe df. This is a convenience method that combines the work of PLOTSampleWtPercents and PLOTSampleCumWtPercents into a single function call.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - General Methods:\n",
    "        - [GetDataFrame](#get data frame): returns a copy to the pandas data frame df that is built in the SedSASampleClass constructor during initialization and is used throughout the class methods for subsequent computations and reporting. This method will likely prove to be useful when calling SedSASampleClass methods directly (rather than doing streamlined processing-see below).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - Streamlined Processing Methods:\n",
    "        - [Analyze2CSV](#analyze2csv): a convenience function that calls ComputeGraphicStats, ComputeMomentStats, and FindSampleModes and writes the results, along with the individual weight percentages, to a comma separated text values file. The user provides a filename when calling this method.\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "        - [Analyze2Stdout](#analyze2stdout): another convenience function that performs much the same work as Analyze2CSV but instead of writing to a file, outputs results all to standard out."
